					not agree to any of the Terms, you may not use the Website or the

					may be required under applicable laws. If you do not agree to our
					changes, you may discontinue your use of the Website and the Services.
					Your continued use of the Website and/or Services after the changes
					take effect amounts to your acceptance of the updated Terms. The date
