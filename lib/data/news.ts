					"1. Choose an Origin address — Head to the NIGHT Claim Portal and click START A NEW CLAIM NOW. You’ll be prompted to select an Origin address. Select the token for which you wish to claim from the list of qualifying tokens/networks and click CONFIRM. Next, you must choose the account address that, during the snapshot, held the tokens you’re claiming for. Depending on the token, you may be presented with up to three options: either to connect via browser wallet, a hardware wallet, or to enter the address manually. Entering an address manually requires advanced knowledge and access to message-signing tools specific to each network and is not recommended if you’re not a power user. For this tutorial, we’ll assume you’re connecting with a browser wallet. Select that option, pick your wallet from the list, and click CONTINUE. Your wallet will prompt you to accept the connection with the NIGHT Claim Portal. To continue, accept the request.",

To claim the full allocation for your wallet, you’ll have to complete the process for each address. c) To move onto the next step, click NEXT.",

Connecting a wallet simplifies the process and is the recommended method. Select your preferred option and click CONTINUE. If you choose to connect a Cardano browser wallet, you’ll be prompted to authorize the connection. When you do, the portal will check if your wallet’s currently active address meets the requirement (i.e., if it’s unused). If it doesn’t, you’ll have to select a different address. Otherwise, click NEXT to continue. b) If you choose to enter an address manually, make sure it has never been used and click CHECK IF UNUSED. If the address passes the check, click NEXT to continue.",

A request will be sent to your wallet and you’ll be prompted to sign the message through your wallet’s interface. To continue, sign the message.
